> -- <cite>Andrew Ng</cite>

There have been three great technological revolutions so far; the agricultural revolution, the industrial revolution, and the computer/internet revolution. 
We are now (early) in the artificial intelligence revolution. Electricity transformed countless industries; AI is doing the same **right now**.

A slightly older video but a good introduction: [Andrew Ng: Artificial Intelligence is the New Electricity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21EiKfQYZXc).
