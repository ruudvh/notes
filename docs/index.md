The following pages are a collection of notes regarding a variety of topics.
Most have been written as cheat-sheets for myself, or as (hopefully) helpful guides for friends.

Feel free to browse around, take what you need. All content distributed under the MIT license,
unless otherwise noted.

Please note that this runs on git and is hosted on GitHub. Notice any errors, have suggestions,
or questions? Feel free to leave a comment or - even better - edit the page directly.
